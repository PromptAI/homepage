## Car Assistant

Cars are common equipment tools in our lives, and there are many equipment machines in them. When we want to know the information of one of the devices, we can quickly build a car device assistant based on the capabilities provided by PromptAI.

### The following is the construction process

> 1. Click "Add Flow Diagram" to create a flow diagram named "Rear Fog Lamp Related", as shown in the figure:
